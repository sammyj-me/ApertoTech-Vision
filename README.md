# ApertoTech-Vision

ApertoTech-Vision is an Open-Source computer vision project that delivers comprehensive running analysis from 2D videos. It uses pose estimation techniques developed with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and JavaScript. 

Our goal is to empower athletes, trainers, and researchers with precise insights into running performance by providing an accessible, cost-effective phone-based solution.

## Features

- Running speed tracking
- Position mapping using forward kinematics
- Automated analysis of running technique, stride length, body alignment, etc.
